### How do I search for a shabad?

After launching SikhiToTheMax, by default you can search for a shabad by entering the first letter of each word. For example, if the shabad is ਗੁਰੁ ਮੇਰੈ ਸੰਗਿ ਸਦਾ ਹੈ ਨਾਲੇ , you would enter "gmsshn". ![](./assets/img/help_images/search_example.gif)

### How do I type in Gurmukhi?

When using SikhiToTheMax, your keyboard will automatically type in Gurmukhi. Reference the keyboard map below to know which character goes with which key. Alternatively, you can click on the Gurmukhi keyboard icon and type in the letters manually.![](./assets/img/help_images/web-desktop-keyboard-map.png)

### How can I adjust the font size?

The easiest way to change the font size is through quick tools. The quick tools menu is available in the preview pane when you are viewing a shabad. ![](./assets/img/help_images/desktop-quick-tools.gif)

### How do I change the background color?

After launching STTM, click the icon for Themes and choose your preferred option. Alternatively, you can scroll to the bottom and upload a custom background image. We recommend a resolution of 1920x1080 for custom backgrounds.

### What do the different search types do?

*   First Letter (Start)
    *   The letters you input must be from the START of a line in a shabad.
    
*   First Letter (Anywhere)
    *   The letters you input can be from any part of the line. For example, you can start your search by typing in the first letter of every word in the second half of a shabad’s line.
    
*   Full Word (Gurmukhi)
    *   You can type in the full word(s) in gurmukhi that you are searching for.
    
*   English Translation (Full Word)
    *   You can search for shabads via the english translations. For example, type in the word "bird" and the results will show all shabads that include a translation for "bird".
    
### Using wildcard when searching

If you are unsure of a letter when searching, you can enter in a * as a wildcard search operator. This will act as a placeholder and will find results against every letter. For example, if the shabad is ਗੁਰੁ ਮੇਰੈ ਸੰਗਿ ਸਦਾ ਹੈ ਨਾਲੇ , you can enter "gms*hn".

### How do I connect STTM to a projector?

Plug in your computer to the projector or TV. Once you do this, go to your computer's display settings and change it to "Extended Desktop" (NOT mirroring). After that, launch STTM and turn on "Presenter View" in the settings! ![](./assets/img/help_images//desktop-extend-pc.png) ![](./assets/img/help_images/desktop-extend-mac.png)


### Can you view the Gurbani in Larivaar?

Yes! After launching STTM, click the icon for Display Settings, and choose the Larivaar option. 


### Where can I see my previous shabads?

When using STTM in “Presenter View”, your history will appear in the bottom right quadrant under the "History" tab. You can click any of the shabads in the list to bring them back up as your primary one.

### Additional Database/Search Information

*   STTM's database includes shabads from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, Sri Dasam Granth Sahib, Bhai Gurdas Jee, Bhai Gurdas Singh Jee, Bhai Nand Lal Jee, and various rehatnamas and thankhanamas. If your shabad is not from one of those sources, it will not appear.
*   If you verified your shabad should be in the database and it is still not coming up, make sure you are typing in the correct letters for search. If you aren’t sure about a letter, or are still having difficulties, try using one of the different search types to locate the shabad.
*   If you don't know one of the letters, consider using an asterisk in its place. Here's some information on how it works:
    *   *First letter start* - 
        `ssnh` it will search for “soche soch na hovayi je sochi lakh vaar”  not “jat sat sanjam naam hai”
    *   *First letter anywhere* - 
        `ssnh` it will search for “soche soch na hovayi je sochi lakh vaar” and “jat sat sanjam naam hai”
    *   *First letter start* - 
        `*ssnh` will search for “jat sat sanjam naam hai” and not “soche soch na hovayi je sochi lakh vaar”
    *   *First letter anywhere* - 
        `*ssnh` will search for “jat sat sanjam naam hai” and not “soche soch na hovayi je sochi lakh vaar”
    *   *First letter start* - 
        `ssnh*` will search for “soche soch na hovayi je sochi lakh vaar” and not  “jat sat sanjam naam hai”
    *   *First letter anywhere* - 
        `ssnh*` will search for “soche soch na hovayi je sochi lakh vaar” and  “jat sat sanjam naam hai”
    *   *First letter start* - 
        `ss*nh` will search for “sukh sagar har naam hai” and neither “soche soch na hovayi..” nor “rasna sacha simriye man tan nirmal hoye”
    *   *First letter anywhere* - 
        `ss*nh` will search for “sukh sagar har naam hai” and “rasna sacha simriye man tan nirmal hoye” but not “soche soch na hovayi…”
